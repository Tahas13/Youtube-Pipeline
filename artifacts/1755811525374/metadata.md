# RAG agent tutorial 2025 — Build a working RAG in 10 minutes

## Description
RAG agent tutorial 2025: Watch a complete step-by-step demo showing how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent from ingestion to deployment in a 10-minute hands-on walkthrough. I’ll show the final working answer up front and then reveal the exact architecture, commands, and the one config that breaks most builds.

What you'll learn: a clear architecture diagram and the role of embeddings, vector DBs (FAISS/Pinecone), retrievers, and LLM chaining; how to ingest and chunk documents, generate embeddings, create an index, tune the retriever, and wire a LangChain/LLM chain (Python + JS pointers included). By the end you’ll have a reproducible repo pattern, concrete optimization tips (batching, caching, chunk rules) to cut API calls ~70–80%, and a short deployment checklist for production readiness.

Call-to-action & channel context: Repo and exact commands are pinned in the top comment and described in the video notes — try the demo and tell me your dataset in the comments. Subscribe for more RAG deep dives, low-latency deployment tutorials, and cost-optimization case studies for LLM systems.
