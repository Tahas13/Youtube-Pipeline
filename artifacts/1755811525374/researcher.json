  "seo_insights": "Put the primary long-tail keyword (e.g., \"RAG agent tutorial 2025\" or \"build RAG agent LangChain\") at the very start of the title and repeat it in the first 150 characters of the description. Aim for a keyword density of ~0.8–1.5% for the primary phrase across the description and mention 2–3 supporting long-tail keywords naturally in the first 300 words; add those as tags, timestamps, and in closed-caption transcripts to boost discovery."
