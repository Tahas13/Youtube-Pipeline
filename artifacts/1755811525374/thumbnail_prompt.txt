Composition: Split-screen, high-contrast colors. Left side: close-up of a focused developer at their terminal (cool blue lighting, code visible on screen). Right side: same developer celebrating (warm golden/orange lighting) with arms slightly raised. Foreground center: an oversized stylized vector database icon (stacked dots) and a small LLM chip/robot symbol. Emotions: curiosity on the left, triumph on the right. Text overlay: large bold text at top 'RAG in 10 MIN' (bright yellow, heavy sans), smaller subtext at bottom 'Build • Optimize • Deploy' (white). Add a red circular badge in the corner: '2025' (white text). Visual style: sharp, high-contrast, YouTube-optimized saturation, slight vignette to focus on faces. Ensure faces occupy ~30% of thumbnail area, icons are clear at 1280x720, and text has a thin dark outline for legibility on mobile.
