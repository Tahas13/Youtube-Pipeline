00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[excited] RAG agent tutorial 2025 — I'll build a working RAG that answers any PDF.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Preview: final answer shown now so you know the payoff. Watch for the one config that breaks relevance.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Quick context: RAG = retrieval + LLM. It saves tokens and gives grounded answers by fetching relevant passages before the model generates.

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:20,000
[Sound Effect] Let's ingest the docs — chunking rule: 500–1,000 tokens with overlap 50–100 tokens for context.

5
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Command: run embedding batch jobs (use async batching). This reduces API calls and improves throughput. I'll show exact snippet now.

6
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Indexing: FAISS for local low-latency; Pinecone for managed scale. Tune dimension and metric (cosine vs dot). Now we run a test retrieval.

7
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:30,000
[emphasis] Retriever tuning: increase k, re-rank top results with cross-encoder or use simple semantic similarity + lexical signals.

8
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Deployment notes: containerize the retriever service, autoscale the embedding workers, and instrument relevance/latency metrics.

9
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Final test: deployed agent answers a fresh query with high relevance. [excited] That's the payoff — reproducible and deployable.
