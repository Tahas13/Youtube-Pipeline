[Excited] You won't believe what most developers get wrong with RAG...

00:00:15 --> 00:00:30
But today, I'll show you how to build a fully functional agent in just 10 minutes.

00:01:30 --> 00:01:45
First, we load our data—[typing sounds]—and generate embeddings using SentenceTransformers.

00:03:00 --> 00:03:15
Now, the retrieval setup: connecting to Pinecone for fast, accurate vector searches.

00:05:00 --> 00:05:15
Here's the magic—integrating LangChain to create our agent with just a few lines of code.

00:07:00 --> 00:07:15
[Surprised] Look at that! It's working flawlessly, answering complex questions from our data.

00:09:00 --> 00:09:15
Deployment tips: keep it cost-effective and scalable for production use.

00:10:00 --> 00:10:15
