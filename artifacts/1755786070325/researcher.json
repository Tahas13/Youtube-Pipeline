  "seo_insights": "Use a keyword-rich title with primary terms (e.g., \"Build a RAG agent\" or \"RAG tutorial LangChain\") and place long-tail phrases in the first 100 characters of the description. Include a timestamped walkthrough, links to the code repo, and a full transcript for better indexing; add tags for vector DB names and frameworks (Pinecone, LlamaIndex, LangChain) to capture search intent."
