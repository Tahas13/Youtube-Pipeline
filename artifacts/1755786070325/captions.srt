Build a RAG agent with LangChain + Pinecone â€” live demo and step-by-step guide.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In this video we'll cover the architecture: ingestion, embeddings, vector DB, retriever, LLM agent, and API.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First we ingest a small dataset, compute embeddings, and index vectors in Pinecone for semantic search queries.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Next we wire the retriever into an agent orchestration layer, craft prompt templates, and run live queries.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sample use case: a customer support RAG agent that answers from product docs with high relevance and low cost.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Finally we'll deploy a lightweight API, discuss monitoring and caching, and show failure cases to avoid in production.
