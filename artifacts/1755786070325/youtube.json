  "description": "Build a RAG agent with LangChain + Pinecone in this hands-on tutorial for developers and ML engineers. I walk through the full architecture — ingestion, embeddings, vector DB indexing, retriever, agent orchestration, prompt design, and a lightweight API deploy — with clear commands, tradeoffs, and a sample customer-support use case. Perfect for beginners who want an end-to-end, reproducible demo without fine-tuning.\n\nFollow along for tooling choices (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate), a recommended minimal repo, and production tips: latency optimizations, cost-per-query estimates, caching, and observability. The repo link, quickstart command, and timestamps are pinned in the top comment — try the Quick Test and comment \"Ran it\" with your chosen vector DB.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:30 Architecture overview\n02:00 Ingestion & embeddings\n08:00 Vector DB setup (Pinecone example)\n14:00 Agent orchestration & prompt design\n20:00 Deploy API, monitoring & failure cases\n24:30 Cost, latency tips & closing",
