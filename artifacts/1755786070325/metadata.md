# Build a RAG agent with LangChain + Pinecone (Step-by-step demo)

## Description
Build a RAG agent with LangChain + Pinecone in this hands-on tutorial for developers and ML engineers. I walk through the full architecture — ingestion, embeddings, vector DB indexing, retriever, agent orchestration, prompt design, and a lightweight API deploy — with clear commands, tradeoffs, and a sample customer-support use case. Perfect for beginners who want an end-to-end, reproducible demo without fine-tuning.

Follow along for tooling choices (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate), a recommended minimal repo, and production tips: latency optimizations, cost-per-query estimates, caching, and observability. The repo link, quickstart command, and timestamps are pinned in the top comment — try the Quick Test and comment "Ran it" with your chosen vector DB.
