High-CTR split composition: left third shows a focused developer at a laptop (cool blue lighting, code on screen), right two-thirds show a large, simplified vector diagram (documents -> embeddings -> vector DB -> chatbot) with warm orange/gold highlights. Overlay a bold headline: top line 'RAG AGENT' in bright white with subtle black stroke, bottom line '10 MINUTES' in large neon yellow. Include small icons: LangChain logo (subtle), FAISS cube, small OpenAI/vector symbol. Emotion: confident, fast, 'I can do this' energy. Colors: high-contrast (deep blue background, warm orange focal area, neon yellow text). Composition: developer left, diagram and bold text right, face and key diagram centered on rule-of-thirds intersection. Add subtle motion blur to the developer's hands to imply speed, and a red 'LIVE DEMO' badge in the corner. Keep text readable at thumbnail size, high contrast, minimal clutter.
