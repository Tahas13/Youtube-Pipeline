  "seo_insights": "Include the primary long-tail keyword in the video title (within the first 60 characters) and repeat it verbatim in the first sentence of the description; aim for a keyword density of ~1.0–1.8% across the title+description and include 3–5 close keyword variations as tags. Add a full transcript/closed captions, timestamped chapters using pillar keywords, and a pinned comment with the repo/link + keyword-rich summary to boost discoverability."
