[Music] Build RAG Agent from Scratch — in 10 minutes I'll show a runnable pipeline you can clone. [excited]

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Quick preview: ask a question and watch the agent fetch the exact document snippet and answer with minimal hallucination.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Setup snapshot: Python, venv, LangChain, an embeddings model, and a vector DB (FAISS or Pinecone). I'll show the exact one-line setup in the pinned repo. [confident]

4
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Embeddings: choose a semantically-strong model and keep consistent dimensions. Chunk your docs with overlap — this fixes context loss. [practical tip]

5
00:04:30,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Vector DB demo: indexing into FAISS, add metadata for filterable retrieval, then run a query to compare raw vs tuned retriever results. Watch the recall vs precision tradeoff. [sound effect]

6
00:08:30,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Agent wiring: LangChain agent + retrieval-augmented prompt template. Add a fallback that cites source IDs to stop hallucinations. Here’s the before/after fix. [surprised]

7
00:09:15,500 --> 00:10:00,000
Deployment tips: three quick optimizations — batching, response caching, and cold-start mitigation — that cut cost and latency. Repo link pinned. [Music][closing] [motivated]
