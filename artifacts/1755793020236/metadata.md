# Build RAG Agent from Scratch in 10 Minutes — Live Demo

## Description
Build RAG Agent from Scratch — in this 10-minute demo I'll show you a runnable pipeline that turns docs into a reliable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent you can clone and run today.

What you'll learn and achieve: a step-by-step walk-through of data ingestion and PII filtering, embedding generation, vector DB choices (FAISS vs Pinecone), retriever tuning, LangChain agent wiring, prompt templates to reduce hallucinations, and three deployment/optimization tweaks that cut cost and latency. By the end you'll have a working repo, a tested retriever, and templates to benchmark accuracy vs latency.

Want the code? Repo link is pinned in the comments — clone, run the one-line setup, and follow chapters. If you like deep-dive demos that ship runnable stacks, subscribe and hit the bell for the next video: "Autoscale RAG on AWS — benchmark & cost tuning." Now jump to the exact part you need in the timestamps below.
