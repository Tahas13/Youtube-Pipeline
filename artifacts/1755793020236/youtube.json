  "description": "Build RAG Agent from Scratch — in this 10-minute demo I'll show you a runnable pipeline that turns docs into a reliable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent you can clone and run today.\n\nWhat you'll learn and achieve: a step-by-step walk-through of data ingestion and PII filtering, embedding generation, vector DB choices (FAISS vs Pinecone), retriever tuning, LangChain agent wiring, prompt templates to reduce hallucinations, and three deployment/optimization tweaks that cut cost and latency. By the end you'll have a working repo, a tested retriever, and templates to benchmark accuracy vs latency.\n\nWant the code? Repo link is pinned in the comments — clone, run the one-line setup, and follow chapters. If you like deep-dive demos that ship runnable stacks, subscribe and hit the bell for the next video: \"Autoscale RAG on AWS — benchmark & cost tuning.\" Now jump to the exact part you need in the timestamps below.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 — Hook: Build RAG Agent from Scratch (what we'll deliver)\n00:15 — Demo preview: quick live answer from docs\n01:00 — Setup overview: repo, env, and prerequisites\n02:00 — Data ingestion & chunking strategy (why chunk size matters)\n03:00 — Embeddings: choosing models & dimensions\n04:00 — Vector DB choices: FAISS vs Pinecone (tradeoffs)\n05:30 — Indexing patterns & metadata (best practices)\n06:30 — Retriever tuning: recall vs precision demo\n07:30 — Agent wiring with LangChain (prompt templates)\n08:30 — Hallucination fix demo: before & after\n09:15 — Deployment & 3 optimization tweaks (cost/latency)\n09:45 — Recap, repo CTA, and next steps",

  "srt": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000\n[Music] Build RAG Agent from Scratch — in 10 minutes I'll show a runnable pipeline you can clone. [excited]\n\n2\n00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:15,000\nQuick preview: ask a question and watch the agent fetch the exact document snippet and answer with minimal hallucination.\n\n3\n00:00:15,500 --> 00:01:30,000\nSetup snapshot: Python, venv, LangChain, an embeddings model, and a vector DB (FAISS or Pinecone). I'll show the exact one-line setup in the pinned repo. [confident]\n\n4\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000\nEmbeddings: choose a semantically-strong model and keep consistent dimensions. Chunk your docs with overlap — this fixes context loss. [practical tip]\n\n5\n00:04:30,500 --> 00:06:30,000\nVector DB demo: indexing into FAISS, add metadata for filterable retrieval, then run a query to compare raw vs tuned retriever results. Watch the recall vs precision tradeoff. [sound effect]\n\n6\n00:08:30,000 --> 00:09:15,000\nAgent wiring: LangChain agent + retrieval-augmented prompt template. Add a fallback that cites source IDs to stop hallucinations. Here’s the before/after fix. [surprised]\n\n7\n00:09:15,500 --> 00:10:00,000\nDeployment tips: three quick optimizations — batching, response caching, and cold-start mitigation — that cut cost and latency. Repo link pinned. [Music][closing] [motivated]\n",
  "thumbnail_prompt": "High-CTR split composition: left third shows a focused developer at a laptop (cool blue lighting, code on screen), right two-thirds show a large, simplified vector diagram (documents -> embeddings -> vector DB -> chatbot) with warm orange/gold highlights. Overlay a bold headline: top line 'RAG AGENT' in bright white with subtle black stroke, bottom line '10 MINUTES' in large neon yellow. Include small icons: LangChain logo (subtle), FAISS cube, small OpenAI/vector symbol. Emotion: confident, fast, 'I can do this' energy. Colors: high-contrast (deep blue background, warm orange focal area, neon yellow text). Composition: developer left, diagram and bold text right, face and key diagram centered on rule-of-thirds intersection. Add subtle motion blur to the developer's hands to imply speed, and a red 'LIVE DEMO' badge in the corner. Keep text readable at thumbnail size, high contrast, minimal clutter."
