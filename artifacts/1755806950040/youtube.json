  "description": "Build RAG Agent Tutorial — watch a complete, beginner-friendly walkthrough that gets a working Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent running in a 10-minute demo. I cut the fluff and show the exact architecture, tools, and commands you need to go from PDFs to a searchable AI assistant.\n\nWhat you'll learn and achieve: step-by-step ingestion of docs, creating embeddings, choosing and indexing into a vector DB (Faiss/Pinecone/Chroma), wiring retrieval to an LLM using LangChain, retrieval-first prompt patterns to reduce hallucinations, plus quick production tips (caching, batching, monitoring). By the end you'll have a deployable RAG pipeline and a checklist for cost and performance tuning.\n\nIf this helps, like 👍 and comment \"RAG\" for the repo link — I'll pin it. Subscribe for weekly AI engineering walkthroughs and deployment guides. Repo & commands in the pinned comment. Timestamps below to jump straight to each step.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Intro & Promise — what we'll build and the timebound outcome\n00:15 Preview demo clip & why RAG matters for docs/support\n01:00 Prereqs & project overview (Python, LangChain, LLM keys)\n02:00 RAG Architecture: ingest → embeddings → vector DB → retriever → LLM\n03:00 Tooling choices: Faiss vs Pinecone vs Chroma (tradeoffs)\n04:00 Ingesting docs & creating embeddings (code walkthrough)\n05:00 Indexing to vector DB and retrieval setup (LangChain code)\n06:00 Wiring retrieval-first prompt & live query demo\n07:00 Debugging hallucinations: prompt patterns & reranking tips\n08:00 Optimization: indexing strategy, latency, cost-saving tactics\n09:00 Quick deploy checklist: containerization, batching, monitoring\n09:30 Recap of 3 key takeaways & next steps (repo + next video on cost)\n10:00 End — CTA: subscribe, repo in pinned comment, what to benchmark next\n\nPrimary keywords used: Build RAG Agent Tutorial, RAG agent tutorial, Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\n",

  "srt": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000\n[Music] Build RAG Agent Tutorial — in this video I'll show a complete, working RAG agent in a 10-minute demo. [excited]\n\n2\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nQuick preview: you’ll see PDFs ingested, embeddings created, a vector index, then live queries answering doc-based questions with near-zero hallucinations.\n\n3\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nPrereqs: Python, an LLM API key, pip install langchain, embeddings library, and a vector DB account or local FAISS. I'll show commands in the pinned comment. [calm]\n\n4\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000\nArchitecture: ingest -> embed -> index -> retrieve -> LLM. Use retrieval-first prompts to ground answers. Default stack I recommend: LangChain + Pinecone (or FAISS locally) + OpenAI or local LLM.\n\n5\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000\nLive code: create embeddings for a folder of PDFs, upsert vectors, then run a similarity search. Watch the terminal — we get top-K passages, then pass them to a concise prompt template.\n\n6\n00:05:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000\nDemo query: (shows question) — note the retrieval context inserted. Result: concise, sourced answer with citation snippet. [surprised] This cut hallucinations dramatically.\n\n7\n00:07:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000\nOptimization tip: use reranking or hybrid search for precision, shard large corpora, and cache frequent queries. Batching embeddings reduces cost. [practical]\n\n8\n00:09:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000\nRecap: 1) ingest and embed, 2) choose right vector DB, 3) use retrieval-first prompts + monitoring. Repo link in pinned comment — try it and comment 'RAG' for the code. [enthusiastic]\n",
  "thumbnail_prompt": "High-contrast, two-panel thumbnail: left side shows a focused developer at a laptop with cool blue lighting and code visible on the screen; right side shows the same person cheering with warm golden lighting and raised hands. Center overlay: bold, 2-line text in large sans-serif: Line1 'RAG AGENT' (bright neon yellow with black stroke) Line2 'IN 10 MINUTES' (white text on red pill). Add small icons: LangChain logo top-left, Pinecone/FAISS icons bottom-right. Include a small 'No Hallucinations' badge (green) near the cheering person. Composition: face clearly visible (60% of left panel), code details blurred but readable, use diagonal split for dynamism. Colors: electric blue + warm gold + neon yellow accent. Emotions: tension -> relief, curiosity -> triumph. Ensure text is readable at 120px and thumbnail stands out on dark-mode YouTube feed."
