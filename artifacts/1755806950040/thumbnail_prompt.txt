High-contrast, two-panel thumbnail: left side shows a focused developer at a laptop with cool blue lighting and code visible on the screen; right side shows the same person cheering with warm golden lighting and raised hands. Center overlay: bold, 2-line text in large sans-serif: Line1 'RAG AGENT' (bright neon yellow with black stroke) Line2 'IN 10 MINUTES' (white text on red pill). Add small icons: LangChain logo top-left, Pinecone/FAISS icons bottom-right. Include a small 'No Hallucinations' badge (green) near the cheering person. Composition: face clearly visible (60% of left panel), code details blurred but readable, use diagonal split for dynamism. Colors: electric blue + warm gold + neon yellow accent. Emotions: tension -> relief, curiosity -> triumph. Ensure text is readable at 120px and thumbnail stands out on dark-mode YouTube feed.
