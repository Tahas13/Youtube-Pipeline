  "seo_insights": "Put a primary long-tail keyword at the start of the title (e.g., \"Build RAG Agent Tutorial\") and repeat 2-3 related long-tail keywords naturally in the first 25 words of the description. Aim for a keyword density around 1–1.5% for each primary phrase (avoid stuffing), include keywords in chapters, tags, and the pinned comment, and add accurate closed captions and a descriptive filename to boost discoverability."
