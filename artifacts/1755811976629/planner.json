  "production_checklist": [
    "Script writing: 2-3 hours including research on latest RAG best practices. Quality gate: Script must include at least 3 visual demonstrations and 2 code examples.",
    "Recording session: 1.5-2 hours with split-screen setup showing code editor and live demonstrations. Quality gate: All code segments must be error-free and properly highlighted.",
    "Editing phase: 4-5 hours with attention to pacing (cuts every 5-7 seconds) and adding animated text overlays for key concepts. Quality gate: Retention curve analysis using editing software tools.",
    "Thumbnail creation: 1 hour producing 3 variations with bold text, contrasting colors, and facial expression (surprise/excitement). Quality gate: A/B test with focus group for highest CTR.",
    "Upload optimization: 30 minutes including keyword-rich description with timestamps, strategic tagging using trending keywords, and end-screen elements. Quality gate: All metadata fields completed with primary keywords in first 100 characters."
