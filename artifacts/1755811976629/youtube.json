  "thumbnail_prompt": "Split-screen composition with dramatic contrast: Left side shows a confused robot with question marks (cool blue tones), right side shows the same robot smiling with lightbulb above head (warm golden glow). Large bold yellow text overlay '10 MINUTE RAG AGENT' with smaller subtext 'SHOCKING RESULTS!'. Include Python and LangChain logos in corners. High contrast, YouTube-optimized colors with glowing effects around the successful robot. Facial expression should show clear transformation from confusion to excitement."
