  "seo_insights": "Use high-intent keywords (e.g., \"RAG agent\", \"LangChain RAG tutorial\", \"deploy RAG\") in the title and first 100 characters of the description, include timestamps and a link to a public GitHub repo for higher click-through and watch time. Add detailed video chapters, an auto-generated transcript, and tags for specific tech (Pinecone, LlamaIndex, LangChain) to capture search and suggested traffic; thumbnails with \"Build in 25m\" or \"Live RAG Demo\" tend to boost CTR."
