00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome — in this video I’ll build a production-ready RAG agent and deploy it live in under 25 minutes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First, a quick demo: a vanilla LLM hallucinated on a question, and the RAG agent gave a source-backed correct answer.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Goal: explain architecture, choose tools, and show a hands-on LangChain / LlamaIndex build with a vector DB.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Architecture highlights: embeddings -> vector database -> retriever -> optional reranker -> LLM agent orchestration.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Tooling: we’ll demo Pinecone and Supabase for vectors, compare Weaviate and Milvus, and use OpenAI or local embedding models.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Setup: clone the repo, provision a vector DB, add API keys to env, and prepare a small demo dataset to index.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Step 1: ingest documents and create embeddings. Step 2: index to the vector DB. Step 3: wire the retriever to the agent.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Next up we'll walk through the code, show retrieval evaluation metrics, deploy a containerized endpoint, and optimize cost.
