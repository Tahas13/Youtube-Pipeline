  "production_checklist": [
    "Script writing (30-45 min): Outline follows hook-promise-payoff structure with timed sections, includes 3 engagement hooks, and integrates target keywords naturally",
    "Recording (45-60 min): High-quality audio (check for background noise), clear visual demonstrations of code, and energetic delivery emphasizing key points",
    "Editing (90-120 min): Add dynamic cuts every 15-30 seconds, insert B-roll for code snippets, overlay text highlights for key terms, and include subtle background music",
    "Thumbnail creation (20-30 min): Use high-contrast colors (red/white), include a code snippet visual, bold text with 'RAG Agent', and a curiosity trigger (e.g., 'SECRET REVEALED')",
    "Upload optimization (15 min): Write description with keywords in first two lines, add timestamps for each section, include 3-5 relevant tags (e.g., RAG tutorial, LangChain), and set end screen to link to a related video"

    "I tested 15 RAG implementations—here's the one mistake that causes 90% to fail (show a quick visual of an error log vs. working demo)",
    "In 60 seconds, I'll show you how to build a RAG agent that outperforms custom-trained models (display a side-by-side performance comparison graph)",
    "This secret architecture pattern makes RAG agents 10x more effective instantly (cue a dramatic transition from a basic to an optimized system flow)",
    "What if you could build an enterprise-grade AI assistant without complex code? (flash a clip of the final demo answering complex queries smoothly)"

  "title_style_notes": [
    "Include power words like 'Secret', 'Instant', or 'Proven' paired with emotional triggers (e.g., 'Stop Wasting Time') to compel clicks",
    "Keep titles under 60 characters for mobile visibility, and place primary keywords ('RAG agent', 'tutorial') at the beginning",
    "A/B test titles with variations: one focused on outcomes ('Build a RAG Agent in 1 Hour') vs. one focused on problems ('Why 90% of RAG Implementations Fail')",
    "Use title case and avoid clickbait—ensure the title accurately reflects the video's content to maintain viewer trust"

    "00:45-04:30: Main content - Step-by-step implementation using LangChain and vector databases (code walkthrough with pauses for explanation)",
    "04:30-06:00: Engagement hook - 'But here's the crazy part...' showcase performance optimization tip (side-by-side benchmark)",
    "06:00-08:45: Advanced techniques - Error handling and deployment strategies (real-world examples with error simulations)",

    "Insert a mid-roll card at 4:00 teasing a bloopers/reel video for bloopers to reduce drop-off",
    "End with a strong CTA: 'Smash like if you learned something, and subscribe for part 2 on deploying to production'",
    "Add a clickable annotation at 7:00 linking to a related video on LangChain basics for newer viewers"
