High-contrast, attention-grabbing thumbnail. Composition: split-screen diagonal split. Left side: a focused developer at a laptop with cool blue lighting, looking concentrated and typing terminal code (show a small visible snippet: 'embeddings -> index -> retriever'). Right side: a close-up of the same developer celebrating with arms up, warm golden lighting, with an overlay of the final chatbot answer in a dialog bubble. Central overlay: bold large text 'RAG AGENT IN 10M' in bright yellow with thick black stroke for readability at small sizes. Secondary smaller text in white: '95% ACCURATE â€¢ 0.8s' placed near the dialog bubble. Include small logos/icons: LangChain icon (left corner), Pinecone & FAISS icons (bottom right), and a small OpenAI icon near the dialog. Emotions: excitement, competence, "I can do this". Color palette: electric blue, warm gold, high-contrast black/white accents. Composition focal points: developer faces, big bold promise text, and the dialog bubble with a short answer visible. Make sure elements are readable at 140px height: large fonts, minimal clutter, high saturation. Add subtle motion blur on left typing hand for dynamism and a small 'LIVE DEMO' red badge in the top-left corner.
