  "description": "How to build a RAG agent — watch a live demo and follow a step-by-step beginner-friendly build that answers private docs in ~0.8s. In this video I show a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent build, explain the architecture, tools, and a sample use case so you can reproduce it end-to-end.\n\nWhat you'll learn / achieve: clear, actionable outcomes.\n- How to choose embeddings and vector DBs (Pinecone vs FAISS) and index your documents.\n- How to wire a retriever + prompt templates to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.\n- Step-by-step LangChain and LlamaIndex examples, code snippets, and Docker deployment config.\n- Performance & cost tips (batching, caching, p95 latency tuning) and security best practices for private data.\n- A complete sample use case: private PDF Q&A chatbot with metrics (latency & accuracy) and repo links.\n\nCall to action & channel context:\nIf you liked this deep technical walkthrough, hit subscribe for weekly production-focused AI builds (RAG, vector DB ops, cost/perf tuning). Repo, timestamps, and deployment configs are pinned in the top comment. Ask which vector DB you use (Pinecone/FAISS/Other) and I’ll give tuning advice in the replies.\n\nTimestamps (first 2 minutes detailed every 15s):\n00:00 — Hook: live demo promise (build RAG agent in 10 min, ~0.8s response)\n00:15 — Quick context: why RAG vs fine-tuning; key deliverables\n00:30 — Preview demo: query a private PDF and show retrieval + answer\n00:45 — Architecture overview: embeddings → vector DB → retriever → generator\n01:00 — Tools & stack: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Pinecone, FAISS, OpenAI embeddings\n01:15 — Sample dataset & preprocessing notes (chunking, metadata)\n01:30 — Demo: show vector retrieval hits and prompt template used\n01:45 — Early optimization tips: batching, caching, and one-line latency fix\n02:00 — What’s coming next: deployment, scaling, and evaluation chapters\n\nFull chapter timestamps and full transcript are included below and in the pinned comment with the repo link. SEO notes: primary phrases used — \"how to build a RAG agent\", \"RAG agent tutorial\", \"retrieval augmented generation\" — appear in the first 150 characters and throughout the transcript for discoverability.",

  "thumbnail_prompt": "High-contrast, attention-grabbing thumbnail. Composition: split-screen diagonal split. Left side: a focused developer at a laptop with cool blue lighting, looking concentrated and typing terminal code (show a small visible snippet: 'embeddings -> index -> retriever'). Right side: a close-up of the same developer celebrating with arms up, warm golden lighting, with an overlay of the final chatbot answer in a dialog bubble. Central overlay: bold large text 'RAG AGENT IN 10M' in bright yellow with thick black stroke for readability at small sizes. Secondary smaller text in white: '95% ACCURATE • 0.8s' placed near the dialog bubble. Include small logos/icons: LangChain icon (left corner), Pinecone & FAISS icons (bottom right), and a small OpenAI icon near the dialog. Emotions: excitement, competence, \"I can do this\". Color palette: electric blue, warm gold, high-contrast black/white accents. Composition focal points: developer faces, big bold promise text, and the dialog bubble with a short answer visible. Make sure elements are readable at 140px height: large fonts, minimal clutter, high saturation. Add subtle motion blur on left typing hand for dynamism and a small 'LIVE DEMO' red badge in the top-left corner."
