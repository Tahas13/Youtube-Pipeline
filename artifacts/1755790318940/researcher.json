  "seo_insights": "Place the primary long-tail keyword (e.g., \"how to build a RAG agent\") in the beginning of the title and within the first 100 characters; include 3–5 long-tail variants in the first 150 characters of the description and the pinned comment. Aim for ~1–1.5% keyword density for primary phrases across title, description, and transcript, use natural phrase variations in headings/timestamps, and add a full transcript and chapter timestamps to boost search relevance."
