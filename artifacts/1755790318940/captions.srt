00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Music] [excited] I asked a private PDF one question —
it returned an accurate answer in 0.8 seconds.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video I'm showing how to build a RAG agent from scratch
and how to reproduce this result.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
[brief pause] We'll cover architecture, tools, and a sample use case
so you can copy the repo and run it locally.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First — why RAG? [calm] It's often faster and cheaper
than full fine-tuning for document Q&A.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
00:15 — Quick context: the core deliverables are code, configs, and metrics.
You'll get latency and accuracy numbers for each step.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
00:30 — Preview demo: watch me query a private PDF.
I'll show the vector retrieval and the final generated answer.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
[Sound Effect] Live demo running — retriever returns top 3 hits,
then the generator composes the final response.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
00:45 — Architecture overview: embeddings into a vector DB,
then a retriever and an LLM generator.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll compare Pinecone and FAISS, and show when to pick each one.
[emphasis] I'll explain tradeoffs: latency, cost, and scale.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
01:00 — Tools & stack: LangChain and LlamaIndex examples,
OpenAI or other embeddings, and vector DB options.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
01:15 — Sample dataset notes: chunking strategy, metadata, and filtering.
Small changes here hugely affect retrieval accuracy.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
[excited] 01:30 — Demo: inspect the retrieval hits—see which chunks matched,
and how the prompt template guides the generator.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
01:45 — Early optimization tips: batch embeddings,
cache frequent queries, and use sparse filters to reduce noise.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
02:00 — What's next: we'll deep dive into deployment,
scaling to 1,000 users and monitoring p95 latency.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
[calm] Now let's build: start with embeddings—I'll show code for batching
and a simple Python example using OpenAI embeddings.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
[Sound Effect] Create your index: example shows Pinecone init,
FAISS local index creation, and metadata mapping.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
[excited] Retriever tuning: adjust k, score threshold, and hybrid search
for better precision and less hallucination.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Prompt engineering: include the source chunks, system instruction,
and an explicit "cite sources" constraint to reduce fabrication.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Deployment notes: containerize with Docker, add a Gunicorn/Uvicorn server,
and set up simple concurrency limits.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Security: encrypt vectors at rest if necessary, apply access controls,
and remove PII before indexing when required.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Evaluation: run retrieval QA tests, measure exact match and MRR,
and check hallucination rates on an eval dataset.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
[encouraging] Repo link is pinned in the top comment — run the demo,
then come back with questions about your dataset.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
