# How to Build a RAG Agent — Live Demo in 10 Minutes (95% Accuracy)

## Description
How to build a RAG agent — watch a live demo and follow a step-by-step beginner-friendly build that answers private docs in ~0.8s. In this video I show a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent build, explain the architecture, tools, and a sample use case so you can reproduce it end-to-end.

What you'll learn / achieve: clear, actionable outcomes.
- How to choose embeddings and vector DBs (Pinecone vs FAISS) and index your documents.
- How to wire a retriever + prompt templates to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy.
- Step-by-step LangChain and LlamaIndex examples, code snippets, and Docker deployment config.
- Performance & cost tips (batching, caching, p95 latency tuning) and security best practices for private data.
- A complete sample use case: private PDF Q&A chatbot with metrics (latency & accuracy) and repo links.

Call to action & channel context:
If you liked this deep technical walkthrough, hit subscribe for weekly production-focused AI builds (RAG, vector DB ops, cost/perf tuning). Repo, timestamps, and deployment configs are pinned in the top comment. Ask which vector DB you use (Pinecone/FAISS/Other) and I’ll give tuning advice in the replies.
